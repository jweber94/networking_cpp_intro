# REST Service with C++
This is a mini project that should realize a basic REST service, written in C++ with the ```boost::asio``` and ```boost::beast``` as well as TLS encryption of the network traffic between the client and the server. 
In the first iteration, the client will be a terminal call, that sends data with ncat and a json file.
