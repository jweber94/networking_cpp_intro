# Ressource Description
This is my implementation of the example code of the ```boost::asio``` tutorial of the website "https://theboostcpplibraries.com/". I.e. the example code relates to https://theboostcpplibraries.com/boost.asio and the upcoming 6 pages of the tutorial. 

In order to learn how ```boost::asio``` works under the hood, this site is a great ressource.
