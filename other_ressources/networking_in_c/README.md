## Ressource Description
This is my own implementation of the tutorial from the medium site https://medium.com/from-the-scratch/http-server-what-do-you-need-to-know-to-build-a-simple-http-server-from-scratch-d1ef8945e4fa. 

The tutorial gives a soild understanding what ```boost::asio``` abstracts away from the user of the library, especially how the socket is implemented, since in C we need to implement all socket details on our own, in ```boost:::asio``` the ```::ip::tcp``` adjusts the socket details implicitly. Therefore, it is a very good learning ressource the get a deep understanding about networking on a really low level of abstraction.
